# Local HTTPs Setup
## Step 1: Install and Trust mkcert

The first step is to install **mkcert** and add its local Certificate Authority (CA) to your system's trust store. This is a one-time setup that allows any certificate generated by mkcert to be trusted by your browser automatically.

* **macOS (with Homebrew)**:
    ```sh
    brew install mkcert
    mkcert -install
    ```
* **Windows (with Chocolatey)**:
    ```sh
    choco install mkcert -y
    mkcert -install
    ```
* **Linux (with a package manager and `nss-tools`)**:
    ```sh
    # Example for Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mkcert libnss3-tools

    mkcert -install
    ```

## Step 2: Generate Your Certificates

Once `mkcert` is installed and trusted, you can create the SSL certificates for your `localhost` domain.

1.  Navigate to the `traefik/certs/local` directory in your project.
    ```
    cd ~/[YOUR_PROJECT_PATH]/traefik/certs/local
    ```
2.  Run the following command to create the `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` files.
    ```sh
    mkcert -cert-file localhost.pem -key-file localhost-key.pem "localhost" 127.0.0.1 ::1
    ```
